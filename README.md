# Calculator
In this project, I made 2 calculators
The first is an age calculator that uses the day, month, and year of birth and also the present day, month and year to calculate the age 
This was tricky understanding the mathematical equations that had to go into computing the current age with the parameters
The calculation is triggered by an onclick event
The second is a normal calculator that carries out basic arithmetic functions
The highlight for me is that I was able to add a function that deletes the last character in the display(this took a while to figure out)
I added comments for better understanding
